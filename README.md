# E2D: Entity Encoder Decoder
 A Privacy-Enhanced Framework for LLMs and RAG Agents

## Overview

With the implementation of the AI EU Act, privacy has become a paramount concern in the development and deployment of AI technologies. The E2D (Entity Encoder Decoder) framework emerges as a robust solution to address these privacy concerns. E2D is a privacy-enhanced framework designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents, offering a reliable way to handle sensitive information while mitigating privacy risks.

## Description

The E2D framework focuses on enhancing the privacy of AI models by encoding and decoding entities in a secure manner. This ensures that delicate information is protected during both the training and inference phases of AI model operations. E2D is particularly beneficial when dealing with closed-source LLMs, providing an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data.

## Details

### Key Features

- **Privacy Preservation**: E2D ensures that sensitive entities are encoded securely, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Compatibility**: The framework can be integrated with various LLMs and RAG agents, making it versatile and adaptable.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed with usability in mind, E2D can be easily incorporated into existing AI workflows.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: By adopting E2D, organizations can align with the privacy requirements stipulated by the AI EU Act and other regulations.

### Components

1. **Entity Encoder**: This component encodes sensitive entities using advanced cryptographic techniques, ensuring that the original data cannot be easily reconstructed without authorization.
2. **Entity Decoder**: The decoder component allows for the secure retrieval of the original entities when necessary, ensuring that only authorized users can access the sensitive information.
3. **Integration Modules**: E2D provides modules for seamless integration with popular LLM frameworks and RAG agents.

## Examples

Below are examples of how to use the E2D framework with different applications.

### Example 1: Integrating E2D with a Language Model

```python
from e2d import EntityEncoder, EntityDecoder

# Initialize the encoder and decoder
encoder = EntityEncoder()
decoder = EntityDecoder()

# Encode sensitive data before using it with the language model
sensitive_data = "John's Social Security Number is 123-45-6789"
encoded_data = encoder.encode(sensitive_data)

# Use the encoded data with the language model
model_input = f"The user's sensitive information is {encoded_data}"
# model_output = language_model.process(model_input)

# Decode the data when necessary
decoded_data = decoder.decode(encoded_data)
print(f"Decoded sensitive information: {decoded_data}")
